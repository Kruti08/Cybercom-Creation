Learning Objectives:
(i) Javascript code Execution process
(ii) 'this' keyword
(iii) Objects and their properties
(iv) Methods
(v) Loops and Iterations
(vi) Different Javascript version

(i)Javascript code execution
---> Javascript engine is a computer program that executes JS code. It is developed by web browser vendors.
     It runs with rendering engine via Document Object Model.

---> Javascript engines:
      ---> V8 by google chrome
      ---> Nitro engine by apple
      ---> Spidermonkey by Mozzila 

(ii) Javascripts code execution process
---> The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the
     machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step.
    
(iii) this keyword in JS
--->  The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

(iv) Objects and their properties:
--->  Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered 
      properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

Ex:  objeect.property   ==> person.age

(v) Methods in Javascript:
---> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.A JavaScript method is a property containing a 
     function definition.

Ex:   object.property = function () {
  	      return Values;
      };  

(vi) Loops:
--->  Loops are used when you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Ex:    for(i=0;i<5;i++){
	     //Code	
	}
