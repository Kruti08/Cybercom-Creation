- Today I tried to learn about the whole process, that starts from our making a file to 
  uploading it on github. That means main focus was on how we manage directories in local
  folder and then how we upload the files on the github.

 ** Whole process in git

  - The whole process is divided into 3 areas:
	(1) Working directory
 	(2) Staging area
	(3) Repository

    (1) Working area:
    ---> It is the area where er currently work, where our files are alive. Here, we make 
 	 files and edit them and perform other tasks that we want to do. Here, we do not 
 	 do operation such as commit.
 
    (2) Staging area:
    ---> In this area , Git starts tracking and saving the changes in file. There chamges
         are saved in .git directory.

    (3) Repository:
    ---> This is everything in our repositories. It stores all the checkpoints or commits.

---> Commands learned:

  (I) Commands related to the connection to remote server

    (i) git remote add [nickname] [repository URL] 
    ---> This command is used when we do not want to use SSH key/Http link.We give is a 
	 nickname.

    (ii) git remote
    ---> To get the list of nickname given to repositories

  (II) Commands related to checkoout

    (i) git checkout [branch name] 	
    ---> to switch from one branch to another
 
    (ii) git checkout [commit_id] -- [file name]
    ---> tihs command is used when in local directory we want to jump to previous commit,
	 or want to get the file from any commit.  
  
  (III) Branch Commands  

    (i) git branch
    ---> To know name of the all the branch

    (ii) git push "remote" "branch"
    ---> this is used to push local repository changes to the hosting service

    (iii) git pull "remote" "branch"
    ---> when we want to pull code from the hosting server to our local directory

  (IV) Push and Pull command

    (i) git push -u [nickname] [branch-type]
    ---> This is used to push all the files to the github remote server from local device.
	 after writing this comments we are asked to provide username and password.

    (ii) git push -all [Variable name]
    ---> This command is used to send the branch commits to our remote repository.

    (iii) git pull [link of repository]
    ---> to fetch and merge all the changes on remote direcotry to the current working
	 directory.

    (iv) git stash pop
    ---> to restored the recent stashed files

    (v) git stash save
    ---> To temporary stores record of all the modified files.
