Learning objectives:
(i) Conditional statements
(ii) Boolean logic
(iii) Truthy and falsy values and Equality operators
(iv) Functions
(v) Arrays

---> I basically had idea about all this topic, As I had studied it before. Today I got to do
     revision of this topics and also by doing exercises My fundamentals regarding HTML and 
     CSS also became batter. 

(1) If.. else.. and switch statement
--->if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
--->else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
--->else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
--->switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

(2) Boolean logic in Javascript
---> JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.

Example: Boolean(9>10)  // Answer if false

(3) Functions:
---> It is a block of code which is written to perform a perticular task

Example:

   function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
  }

(4) Arrays: 
---> arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Example: var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];   	
        - var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");

(5) Truthy and Falsy values:
---> Following values are falsy:
          ---> 0
          ---> null
          ---> NaN
          ---> undefined
          ---> '' or ""
          ---> false

---> All the other values are truthy. 
---> In short we can say that if we get falsy value as an output in our expression, then it
     is considered as false in cconditional statements.
