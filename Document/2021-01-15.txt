--> Learning Objectives:
    (i) Inheritance
    (ii) Object Function
    (iii) Premitives vs. object

---> As I already knew the object oriented concepts, today I revised all the object oriented
     concept and implemented them in Javascript language.

---> Inheritance is basically one of the properties of object oriented programming. In which,
     a child class inherit the properties of the parent class. In short, Inheritance helps in
     reusability of the code.

---> Today used almost all the function which I have used in past so just got to revise it and
     did exercise related to html and css.
