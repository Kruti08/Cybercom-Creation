Learning objectives:
  (i) Introduction to html and CSS
  (ii) Introduction to Javascript
  (iii) Javascript Variables and operators 

--> As I already had idea about html,css and javascript. Today's session helped me to brush up my concept and to learn new this.

(1) New thing learned in html:
---> <figure> : this tag is used to contain image with it's caption.
---> <figcaption> : this tag is used to write caption to the image.
---> I learned about new concept introduced in html5: <header>,<article>,<footer>,<section>. this elements are used to provide 
     better structure for html.

(2)Things in CSS:
---> today, I revised and learn new CSS properties.this attributes are as following:
---> To position the component according to parent element: position: absolute,relative,flex, etc.
---> and other properties like:
          ---> border
          ---> padding
          ---> Margin
          ---> background

(3)Things in javascript:
---> I got to learned that javascript is a dynamically types language
---> the data type in javascript are:
          ---> number: float, double and int
          ---> boolean: for true or false
          ---> string: sequence of characters
          ---> undefined: when we do not assign value to variable
          ---> null: when variable do not contain in value

---> Operators in javascript:
          ---> Arithmatic: +,-*,-
          ---> logical: >,<,>=,<=,?

--->Precedance in Javascript:
          ---> in javascript the most precedence is 20 which is of ().
          ---> So, there is a precedence table where precedence is assigned from 20 to 0. where operator are mentioned and it is 
               also mentioned that how for some operator precedence is checked from left to right.
