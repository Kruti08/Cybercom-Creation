Introduction to Git and Githib: 

Learning Objectives:
(1) Create a account on Github
(2) Download Git
(3) Basic Git commands

--> As I already created Github account in past and also downloaded git in advance, so did 
not had to do it again. So I started with basic git commands.

(1)It is necessary to first configure user information for all the repositories that exist
   on individuals github page. So, Command for that are:

  (i) git config --global user.name "[Firstname Lastname]"
  --> By this command we can set the specific name for the user, so when one needs to track
      the activity it is easy to find which user commited the change.

  (ii) git config --global user.email "[Valid Email-address]"	
  --> This is to associate the email with the user.

(2) Now the following command are there to configure user information and to initialize and 
    clone the repositories.
  
  (i) git init
  --> This command is used to initialize the existing folder as git repository.

  (ii) git clone [url]
  --> If the whole directory is hostel at some location, this command is useful to retrive 
      directory from there.

(3) Now, It is really important to check the status of files and also when we want to commit 
    the changes in file. Some actions are like add new file, update the file and find what new
    thing is added to repository.

  (i) git status
  --> This is used to show the modified files in the current directory on which we are working.

  (ii) git add[file]
  --> We want to add new file in the repository and it is seems like the next commit to be 
      madw by user.
  
  (iii) git diff
   --> This command is used to check the difference made in the file which is yet to be commited.

  (iv) git commit -m "[Message]"
  --> This command is there to show the message we want to show when a user perform a commit 
      operation. 

(4) Branch

  (i) git branch
  --> this is used to list all the branches. To know that which branch is currently working,
      there appears a * before a branch name.
 
  (ii) git branch[branch-name] 
  --> This command is used to create a new branch in the current commit user wants to do.

(5) Merge

  (i) git merge[branch]
  --> This command is used when one wants to merge the history of any branch to the current 
      branch.

  (ii) git log
  --> As we know log is basically there to keep track of your activity. Sameway in Git it
      tracks all the commits done in branch.
