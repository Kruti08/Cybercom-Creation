Learning bjective:

(1) DOM and DOM Manipulation
(2) Events and event handling

--->So, I have already studies about DOM manipulation in past. So today's session helped me to revice all 
    the concepts of DOM- Document Object Model. which is mainly used to intract HTML with Javascript

---> In DOM, we create a tree. For which root element is HTML and it's children are head and body. So. It
     represents all the elements in terms of nodes and as per ther connectivity they create a tree.

---> We use different method to access id, classes and elements of HTML page in script using DOM object.

Ex:  (i) getElementByID(id)
     (ii) getElementsByTagName(name)
     (iii) getElementsByClassName(name) 

---> By using this, we can also chabge HTMl Elements

Ex:  (i) element.innerHTML = "content to be replaced"
     (ii) element.style.property = new style // To change the style dynamically

---> And there are many more methods I learned and Practice today. 
---> I also got to learn implementation of new HTML5 tags and regarding session and local storage.
